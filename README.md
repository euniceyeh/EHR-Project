# EHR-Project
- This is a final project for the Fall 2017 course of [Data Science](http://datasciencelabs.github.io/) (BST 260) at [HSPH](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) on Electronic Health Records (EHR) Usage in the United States by 2016.
- Group members are Katherine Wang, Lauren Yoo, and Eunice Yeh.
- Instead of having one RMarkdown file for the analysis report, we have several in this repository that compiles into one [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), which can be viewed online [here](http://EHR-Project.github.io/) or you can view the html files under `/Pages` in this repository (recommend starting with `index.html` and prepending the URL with `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?`).
- A summary and visual presentation of our main findings can be found on our [project website](http://BST-260-Final-Project.github.io/), which also includes our screencast.
- The main objective of our project is to analyze the effects of pracitioner and hospital demographics on the usage of Electronic Health Records (EHR) among those participating in the Medicare & Medicaid EHR Incentive Program in the United States by 2016 (most recent complete data available).

Hope you enjoy!
