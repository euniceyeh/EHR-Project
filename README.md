# BST 260 EHR Project
- This is a final project for the Fall 2017 course in [Data Science I](http://datasciencelabs.github.io/) (BST 260) at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) on the Use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in the United States by 2016.
- Group members are [Katherine Wang](https://github.com/katwang/), [Lauren Yoo](https://github.com/jmybhm), and [Eunice Yeh](https://github.com/euniceyeh/).
- The complete final analysis report is organized across a few chapters of `.Rmd` files in this repository that all together compiles into one [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), which can be viewed online [here](https://euniceyeh.github.io/EHR-Project/) or you can view the html files under `/docs` in this repository (we recommend starting with `index.html` and prepending the URL with `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?`).
- All analysis-ready R datasets are stored in `/data`.
- A summary and visual presentation of our main findings can be found on our [project website](https://katwang.github.io/BST-260-Final-Project-Site/), which also includes our screencast.
- The main objective of our project is to understand the relationship of EHR use with eligible providers, both physicians (EPs) and hospitals, in the [2016 Medicare & Medicaid EHR Incentive Program](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/2016ProgramRequirements.html) across the United States. We also explore the demographics of both provider types by geographical regions and by EHR vendors as our secondary objectives.

Hope you enjoy our project!


EDIT------------
Due to our issues with bookdown, we have restructured our repository.

The documentation needed for grading are:
- **Data**: our .rds files are available in the 'data' folder
- **R Markdown Files**: all the .rmd files starting with a number, i.e. '01-Work.Rmd'
- **HTML**: all HTML files can be found in the 'docs' folder

Please note that the original bookdown [link](https://euniceyeh.github.io/EHR-Project/data.html#eligible-hospitals-hosp) still works. It may be more convenient to use that to open and view each of our HTML files. The left-hand panel can be used to toggle through all chapters of our report. However, the primary and secondary analysis chapters will take you to a new page (from which you can just use the 'back' button to return to the bookdown).
