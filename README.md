# EHR-Project
- This is a final project for the Fall 2017 course in [Data Science I](http://datasciencelabs.github.io/) (BST 260) at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) on the Use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in the United States by 2016.
- Group members are [Katherine Wang](https://github.com/katwang/), [Lauren Yoo](https://github.com/jmybhm), and [Eunice Yeh](https://github.com/euniceyeh/).
- The complete final analysis report is organized across a few chapters of `.Rmd` files in this repository that all together compiles into one [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), which can be viewed online [here](https://euniceyeh.github.io/EHR-Project/) or you can view the html files under `/docs` in this repository (we recommend starting with `index.html` and prepending the URL with `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?`).
- All analysis-ready R datasets are saved under `/data`.
- A summary and visual presentation of our main findings can be found on our [project website](http://BST-260-Final-Project.github.io/), which also includes our screencast.
- The main objective of our project is to understand the relationship of EHR use with both types of eligible providers, professionals (EPs) and hospitals, in the [2016 Medicare & Medicaid EHR Incentive Program](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/2016ProgramRequirements.html) across the United States. We also explore the demographics of both types of providers across specific types of EHR vendors as our secondary objective.

Hope you enjoy!
