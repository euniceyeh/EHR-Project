["questions.html", "Chapter 3 Initial Questions", " Chapter 3 Initial Questions What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis? Since the Medicare &amp; Medicaid EHR Incentive Program accepts two types of providers in two different ways, our primary objective of looking at provider demographics on the use of EHR is split into two separate parts: What are the demographics of eligible physicians in the incentive program who have been using EHR; are these different from those who have yet to use EHR? What are the demographics of eligible hospitals in the incentive program who have been using EHR; are these different from those who have yet to use EHR? Our secondary objectives are then: Are all of these demographics and effects on EHR use different geographically? What are the demographics of both types of providers who use EHR by the specific EHR vendor or product types? "],
["data.html", "Chapter 4 Data 4.1 Eligible Professionals (EPs) 4.2 Eligible Hospitals (Hosp) 4.3 Vendors &amp; Products (EHR)", " Chapter 4 Data All of our data are based on the 2016 Medicare &amp; Medicaid EHR Incentive Program since the adoption of EHR is an ongoing basis: a provider who adopted and used EHR during the 2014 program, for example, is likely to still be in the program the following years. So theorethically, the 2016 program would be the most cumulative source of providers adopting EHR. As mentioned in Related Work, the adoption of EHR has been consistently rising over the years across the U.S., so there is also no interest in looking at the use over time when we can just look at the latest collection of data. And since 2017 isn’t quite over yet, it wouldn’t be fair to start looking at the usage of EHR within the 2017 program, so the most recent completed data would be on the 2016 program. 4.1 Eligible Professionals (EPs) To answer the first of our Initial Questions as to whether or not a physician’s age, education, practice location, etc. may be related to their use of EHR in the incentive program, we must be able to find demographics data at the practitioner level. 4.1.1 Source/Metadata And here we are: readily available on Data.Medicare.gov are the demographics of physicians eligible for the Medicare &amp; Medicaid EHR incentive program at the practitioner level. We used the api link to read in the dataset and applied SQL filtering options to speed up the download since it is a large file. we specified the limit to be exactly 2254703 because that’s the exact number of rows the data contain, if we don’t specify this the default limit of rows that get downloaded is 100. to compensate, we will specify specific columns to download, which also be specified in the download link (looked thru metadata on the website to select variables i’m interested in). # change limit to 2254703 on the final run dat &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://data.medicare.gov/resource/c8qv-268j.csv?$limit=10000&amp;$select=npi,frst_nm,gndr,cred,med_sch,grd_yr,pri_spec,cty,st,zip,hosp_afl_1,hosp_afl_lbn_1,ehr&amp;$order=npi&quot;) 4.1.2 Wrangling Let’s first take a look at the data structure and a summary of all the columns. str(dat) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 10000 obs. of 13 variables: ## $ cred : Factor w/ 16 levels &quot;&quot;,&quot;AU&quot;,&quot;CNA&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ cty : Factor w/ 2023 levels &quot;ABBEVILLE&quot;,&quot;ABERDEEN&quot;,..: 454 56 1548 524 1785 217 1093 1093 74 74 ... ## $ ehr : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;: 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ frst_nm : Factor w/ 1872 levels &quot;AAMIR&quot;,&quot;AARON&quot;,..: 155 155 155 1722 1408 409 763 763 917 917 ... ## $ gndr : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;F&quot;,&quot;M&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 ... ## $ grd_yr : int 1994 1994 1994 2003 1999 2003 2007 2007 1997 1997 ... ## $ hosp_afl_1 : int 490126 490126 490126 140010 360262 391312 360098 360098 60024 60024 ... ## $ hosp_afl_lbn_1: Factor w/ 1450 levels &quot;&quot;,&quot;ABBEVILLE AREA MEDICAL CENTER&quot;,..: 615 615 615 341 743 919 584 584 1333 1333 ... ## $ med_sch : Factor w/ 210 levels &quot;A T STILL UN, ARIZONA SCHL OF DENT.Y &amp; ORAL HLTH&quot;,..: 101 101 101 160 101 108 128 128 97 97 ... ## $ npi : int 1003000126 1003000126 1003000126 1003000134 1003000142 1003000407 1003000423 1003000423 1003000480 1003000480 ... ## $ pri_spec : Factor w/ 72 levels &quot;ADDICTION MEDICINE&quot;,..: 33 33 33 53 3 21 44 44 24 24 ... ## $ st : Factor w/ 53 levels &quot;AK&quot;,&quot;AL&quot;,&quot;AR&quot;,..: 47 47 47 15 36 39 36 36 6 6 ... ## $ zip : int 201662247 222053610 241537474 602011718 436082675 158251367 440608702 440608702 800452545 800452545 ... summary(dat) ## cred cty ehr frst_nm gndr ## :9575 PITTSBURGH : 209 :8623 MICHAEL : 182 F:5699 ## MD : 253 HOUSTON : 156 Y:1377 SARAH : 134 M:4301 ## PA : 39 NEW YORK : 125 JENNIFER: 127 ## PT : 29 ANN ARBOR : 119 DAVID : 103 ## NP : 19 DALLAS : 117 MATTHEW : 92 ## OD : 17 PHILADELPHIA: 99 JOHN : 89 ## (Other): 68 (Other) :9175 (Other) :9273 ## grd_yr hosp_afl_1 ## Min. :1963 Min. : 10001 ## 1st Qu.:2004 1st Qu.:140011 ## Median :2009 Median :260032 ## Mean :2007 Mean :269085 ## 3rd Qu.:2012 3rd Qu.:390147 ## Max. :2017 Max. :800001 ## NA&#39;s :9 NA&#39;s :3156 ## hosp_afl_lbn_1 ## :3171 ## UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA MEDICAL CENTER : 64 ## BANNER PAYSON MEDICAL CENTER : 63 ## UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HEALTH SYSTEM : 60 ## PROVIDENCE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER EVERETT: 59 ## EASTERN MAINE MEDICAL CENTER : 56 ## (Other) :6527 ## med_sch npi ## OTHER :6302 Min. :1.003e+09 ## BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE : 73 1st Qu.:1.003e+09 ## UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA COLLEGE OF MEDICINE: 67 Median :1.003e+09 ## LAKE ERIE COLLEGE OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE: 63 Mean :1.003e+09 ## NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE : 59 3rd Qu.:1.003e+09 ## INDIANA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE : 58 Max. :1.004e+09 ## (Other) :3378 ## pri_spec st ## NURSE PRACTITIONER :1569 TX : 780 ## PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT :1053 CA : 768 ## INTERNAL MEDICINE : 936 PA : 679 ## PHYSICAL THERAPY : 652 FL : 612 ## FAMILY PRACTICE : 638 NY : 592 ## CERTIFIED REGISTERED NURSE ANESTHETIST: 541 MI : 422 ## (Other) :4611 (Other):6147 ## zip ## Min. : 603 ## 1st Qu.:212086417 ## Median :452192364 ## Mean :476032054 ## 3rd Qu.:752434115 ## Max. :998017863 ## Observations from the above output: There are 53 levels of states, which means this data include states outside of the 50 mainland states and DC. we don’t have sufficient data on the virgin islands and guam, so we will have to filter these states out. There is one person whose gender is unknown, we will filter this person out since we want to group by gender. There are rows with missing graduation years, will need to filer this out too if graduation years is one of the main demographics of interest (will mess up plotting). Also, one or more physician who graduated in 2017 slipped into our data…we will ignore this by filtering it out too. The zip code, 603, is out of range. a standard zip code has to be at least 5 digits. looks like most zip codes in this data are the full 9-digit zip codes, which can be split into the standard 5-digit format and the 4-digit after. There are way too many levels of medical schools and primary specialties, we will probably focus on looking at the most popular ones for exploratory analysis. data(&quot;state&quot;) clean &lt;- dat %&gt;% filter(st %in% c(state.abb, &quot;DC&quot;)) %&gt;% filter(gndr %in% c(&quot;F&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) &amp; !is.na(as.integer(grd_yr)) &amp; grd_yr != 2017) Now we only have 51 levels of states, 2 levels of gender, and no records with missing graduation year. But we still have zip codes as small as 2138, which is still out of range. To make sure only keep valid zip codes (since there may be other ways the zip codes are not clean), we can try to use R’s zip code package to validate our zip codes. # separate out the first five zip codes from the last four extension to match R zipcode data clean &lt;- clean %&gt;% mutate(zip.ext = substr(as.character(zip), 6, 9), zip = substr(as.character(zip), 1, 5)) # use R zipcode package and data library(zipcode) data(&quot;zipcode&quot;) zip_dat &lt;- clean %&gt;% left_join(zipcode,by=&#39;zip&#39;) # check if any of the invalid zip codes were matched to R&#39;s zip code package zip_dat %&gt;% filter(nchar(zip) &lt; 5) %&gt;% select(npi, frst_nm, zip, cty, st, city, state) %&gt;% head(15) ## npi frst_nm zip cty st city state ## 1 1003003088 AVANI 8824 KENDALL PARK NJ &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 1003021866 DONNA 8060 MOUNT HOLLY NJ &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 1003024142 ALLISON 7719 WALL NJ &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 1003033390 BRIAN 6385 WATERFORD CT &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 1003033390 BRIAN 6385 WATERFORD CT &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 1003041427 LAURIE 8302 BRIDGETON NJ &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 1003149451 COURTNEY 8401 ATLANTIC CITY NJ &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 1003149477 ASHLEY 7430 MAHWAH NJ &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 9 1003150137 ALAN 2601 HYANNIS MA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 10 1003162132 JESSICA 4901 WATERVILLE ME &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 11 1003188954 KIMBERLY 2557 OAK BLUFFS MA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 12 1003228479 LAUREN 3103 MANCHESTER NH &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 13 1003248204 KELLY 2138 CAMBRIDGE MA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; As expected, none of the zip codes with only 4 digits matched, so these 13 records will have to be thrown away in order for us to be able to accurately do analysis on the location variables and regional analysis and to match with the vendor data by zip code. zip_mismatch &lt;- zip_dat %&gt;% mutate(st = as.character(st)) %&gt;% filter(st != state | nchar(zip) &lt; 5) %&gt;% select(npi, frst_nm, zip, cty, city, st, state, latitude, longitude) # check number of records mismatched nrow(zip_mismatch) ## [1] 399 # look at the top five mismatches (top5_mismatch &lt;- zip_mismatch %&gt;% group_by(zip, cty, st, city, state) %&gt;% summarize(n = n()) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% head(5)) ## # A tibble: 5 x 6 ## # Groups: zip, cty, st, city [5] ## zip cty st city state n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 21156 BOSTON MA Upper Falls MD 10 ## 2 16550 WORCESTER MA Erie PA 7 ## 3 22152 BOSTON MA Springfield VA 7 ## 4 23602 PLYMOUTH MA Newport News VA 7 ## 5 31033 MANCHESTER NH Haddock GA 7 In order to not just blatantly throw away 399 mismatches, we will look at the top 5 most common mismatches on a case-by-case basis to try to salvage as many records as possible without searching too deeply in our dataset. Also, starting from the 6th most common mismatches, the number of records n were down to 58 or less, so they would have little effect on the dataset. The results of searching up the top 10 mismatches on Google Maps: The zipcode 99362 spans across Walla Walla in both WA and OR, so it is likely that the practice is located on the WA side of the zipcode coverage. We will ignore the state mismatch from the zipcode package for this case. The zipcode 52761 does belong to Muscatine, IA, which is right on the border of IL. Again, the practice is most likely located on the IA side. Will ignore the state mismatch for this case as well. The zip code for Granger, IN was most likely mistyped. The correct zip code for Granger is 46530, which is very close to 43530. We will fix the zipcode for this particular case only. The zipcode 22401 does belong to Frederickburg, VA, and is not near the border of VA and MD at all. There is a “Frederick” city in MD, but none of its zipcodes look similar enough to 22401. No clear culprit, will have to let this one go. :( The zipcode for Hanover, MD is 21076, which was most likely mistyped as 20176. We will fix this particular case as well. # leave out the 22401 Fredericksburg MD mismatch, fix the zip codes for Granger and Hanover. zip_fix &lt;- top5_mismatch %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% filter(cty != &#39;FREDERICKSBURG&#39;) %&gt;% mutate(zip = replace(zip, zip %in% c(43530, 20176), c(46530, 21076))) %&gt;% select(-n) mismatch_tokeep &lt;- zip_dat %&gt;% select(-zip) %&gt;% # we want to replace the original wrong zip codes with the fixed zip codes inner_join(zip_fix, by = c(&#39;cty&#39;,&#39;st&#39;, &#39;city&#39;, &#39;state&#39;)) ## Warning: Column `st` joining factor and character vector, coercing into ## character vector clean &lt;- zip_dat %&gt;% mutate(st = as.character(st), state = as.character(state)) %&gt;% filter(st == state | nchar(zip) == 5) %&gt;% # keeping only the matches bind_rows(mismatch_tokeep) %&gt;% # then add in the mismatches we wanted to keep or have fixed select(-city, -state) # will rely on the original city and state columns Continuing on with our wrangling… About 31.56% of the (original) data are of physicians not affiliated with any hospital, these are the practitioners we will subset on to do our practitioner-level analysis on since these are the only cases when a physician’s demographics can have an effect on the choice of using EHR. For physicians who are affiliated with a hospital, their demographics would no longer be informative as to whether or not they use EHR, it would then have to be the demographics of the hospitals that could inform the use of EHR at the hospital-level. Thus, we were able to find hospital demographics such as ___ on hospitals across the U.S. in general, which will be discussed in the next section within this chapter, but there’s no indication of participation in the incentive program nor EHR use, so we will have to merge that hospital demographic data with the practitioners in this dataset who are affiliated with any one hospital. for the practitioner-level analysis we want to: Calculate the number of years since graudation Use 1’s and 0’s instead of ‘Y’ and blanks as indicator of EHR use for our binary outcome Keep only one record per physician, which means we would have to lose the distinct practice locations for physicians who have multiple practices. But since we can’t fit our logistic model with either city, state, or zip code, there’s no point in keeping this detail. Instead, we can calculate the number of distinct practices these physicians have in order to collapse the data to the practitioner level.

The hosp_afl data set, still containing one row per physician per hospital location, is to be merged with the hospital demographics data discussed in the next section. Both EPs and the merged-to-be data of hosp_afl containing the hospital demographics are to be merged with the EHR vendor and product information in the last section of this chapter, in order to explore both physician and hospital demographics by specific types of EHR used. 4.2 Eligible Hospitals (Hosp) General hospital demographics such as the total number of staffed beds, total number of discharges, total number of patient days, and total gross patient revenue (inpatient and outpatient) are all publicly accessible on the American Hospital Directory organized by U.S. states. Since there is not a .csv file ready for us to download and the hospital demographics are already neatly summarized in a table for each state, we decided that we could do some web scraping for this. 4.2.1 Source/Metadata The link to each U.S. state’s summary table of hospital demographics by hospital name in that state begins with the same URL: https://www.ahd.com/states/hospital_ and ends with the state’s abbreviation plus a .html. For example, a table of hospital demographics for each hospital in Massachusetts can be directly scraped from the link, https://www.ahd.com/states/hospital_MA.html. The details of these hospital statistics are described here. hosp_web &lt;- data.frame() for (st in c(state.abb, &quot;DC&quot;)){ url = paste(&quot;https://www.ahd.com/states/hospital_&quot;, st, &quot;.html&quot;, sep=&#39;&#39;) st_df &lt;- read_html(url) %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;table&quot;) %&gt;% .[[2]] %&gt;% html_table() st_df &lt;- as.data.frame.matrix(eval(parse(text=st))) # removing the TOTAL row at the end of each table st_df &lt;- st_df[!(st_df$&quot;Hospital Name&quot;==&quot;T O T A L&quot;),] st_df$State &lt;- st hosp_web &lt;- rbind(hosp_web, st_df) } 4.2.2 Wrangling Let’s take a look at the data structure of the raw scrapped hospital demographics. str(hosp_web) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 3907 obs. of 7 variables: ## $ Hospital_name : chr &quot;Alaska Native Medical Center&quot; &quot;Alaska Regional Hospital&quot; &quot;Bartlett Regional Hospital&quot; &quot;Central Peninsula General Hospital&quot; ... ## $ City : chr &quot;Anchorage&quot; &quot;Anchorage&quot; &quot;Juneau&quot; &quot;Soldotna&quot; ... ## $ Staffed_beds : chr &quot;152&quot; &quot;174&quot; &quot;57&quot; &quot;106&quot; ... ## $ Total_discharges : chr &quot;7,320&quot; &quot;6,405&quot; &quot;1,710&quot; &quot;2,575&quot; ... ## $ Patient_days : chr &quot;38,687&quot; &quot;33,507&quot; &quot;6,325&quot; &quot;10,186&quot; ... ## $ Gross_patient_revenue: chr &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$947,754&quot; &quot;$147,231&quot; &quot;$305,469&quot; ... ## $ State : chr &quot;AK&quot; &quot;AK&quot; &quot;AK&quot; &quot;AK&quot; ... To do: We need to turn all the demographic information into numeric columns so we can use them as continuous variables. These values are reported with commas, so we need to strip these out. All the gross patient revenues are reported with a dollar sign in addition to the commas, so we need to strip those out too. Proper cases are harder to match on, will convert all letters in city and hospital name to upper case. It looks like some hospital has a gross patient revenue of $0…is this possible? Will explore this after dealing with all of the above first. hosp_clean &lt;- transform(hosp_web, Staffed_beds = as.numeric(gsub(&quot;,&quot;, &quot;&quot;, Staffed_beds)), Total_discharges = as.numeric(gsub(&quot;,&quot;, &quot;&quot;, Total_discharges)), Patient_days = as.numeric(gsub(&quot;,&quot;,&quot;&quot;, Patient_days)), Gross_patient_revenue = as.numeric(gsub(&quot;\\\\$|,&quot;, &quot;&quot;, Gross_patient_revenue)), Hospital_name = toupper(Hospital_name), City = toupper(str_trim(as.character(City))) ) summary(hosp_clean) ## Hospital_name City Staffed_beds Total_discharges ## Length:3907 Length:3907 Min. : 0.0 Min. : 0 ## Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.: 48.0 1st Qu.: 1244 ## Mode :character Mode :character Median : 133.0 Median : 4562 ## Mean : 204.8 Mean : 8017 ## 3rd Qu.: 264.0 3rd Qu.: 11336 ## Max. :36985.0 Max. :136646 ## Patient_days Gross_patient_revenue State ## Min. : 0 Min. : 0 Length:3907 ## 1st Qu.: 4104 1st Qu.: 98340 Class :character ## Median : 18892 Median : 377425 Mode :character ## Mean : 37794 Mean : 797958 ## 3rd Qu.: 51621 3rd Qu.: 1001421 ## Max. :695643 Max. :15618749 It looks like the zero value wasn’t just for the gross patient revenue. From the summary output, we can see that the minimum values on all hospital demographics (staffed beds, total discharges, patient days, gross patient revenue) are zero, which doesn’t seem right. Theorethically, it is impossible for any functioning hospital to have a total of zero on any of these characteristics. Would having a total of zero number of staffed beds really make it a hospital? Can a hospital survive on a gross patient revenue of zero dollars? We thought that it might be a web scrapping error, but when we went back and looked on the website, some of their tables definitely have random zero hospital statistics and some even have a whole row of zeros for certain hospitals. The metadata wasn’t very clear on this, but it seems like it is their way of representing missing data. Instead of keeping them as zeros, which would affect any computation we want to perform on these continuous variables, we will convert every zero into a true missing value, NA. But if a hospital has all missing demographics (the entire row of zeros), then we will just remove that hospital entirely (delete the whole row). # the demographics are columns 3 to 6 of the data frame is.na(hosp_clean[,3:6]) &lt;- !hosp_clean[,3:6] # turn 0&#39;s to NAs hosp_clean &lt;- hosp_clean[rowSums(is.na(hosp_clean)) &lt; 4,] # only delete hosp with all four NAs summary(hosp_clean) ## Hospital_name City Staffed_beds Total_discharges ## Length:3456 Length:3456 Min. : 1.0 Min. : 1 ## Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.: 73.0 1st Qu.: 2141 ## Mode :character Mode :character Median : 157.0 Median : 5692 ## Mean : 231.6 Mean : 9087 ## 3rd Qu.: 290.0 3rd Qu.: 12564 ## Max. :36985.0 Max. :136646 ## NA&#39;s :1 NA&#39;s :9 ## Patient_days Gross_patient_revenue State ## Min. : 1 Min. : 2298 Length:3456 ## 1st Qu.: 7740 1st Qu.: 188177 Class :character ## Median : 23922 Median : 504646 Mode :character ## Mean : 42838 Mean : 923192 ## 3rd Qu.: 57391 3rd Qu.: 1149258 ## Max. :695643 Max. :15618749 ## NA&#39;s :9 NA&#39;s :79 Now the minimum value is 1…still questionable and potentially causing the skew in their distributions. But we did take a look at these specific hospitals with any one demographic characteristic of value 1 and they seem to also have low values of the other characteristics as well (not necessarily exactly of 1, that would’ve been even more suspicious), so these may very well be valid who knows. Anyway, we need to move on with our lives, I mean, to merging with hosp_afl (which is a subset of practitioners who are affiliated with a hospital from the previous section) on the hospital name and state since different hospitals in different locations can have the same name. Since hosp_afl can have multiple rows per hospital if more than one physician in the data is affiliated with it, so we will aggregate the data back to hospital-level after the merge by summarizing physician-level information. hosps &lt;- inner_join(hosp_clean, hosp_afl, by=c(&quot;Hospital_name&quot;=&quot;hosp_afl_lbn_1&quot;, &quot;State&quot;=&quot;st&quot;)) hosps &lt;- hosps %&gt;% group_by(hosp_afl_1, Hospital_name, State, Staffed_beds, Total_discharges, Patient_days, Gross_patient_revenue) %&gt;% summarize(num_phys = n_distinct(npi), female_prop = round(mean(ifelse(gndr == &quot;F&quot;, 1, 0)),2), avg_grad_year = round(mean(grd_yr),2), n_specialty =n_distinct(pri_spec), EHR_use = as.factor(max(ehr))) summary(hosps) ## hosp_afl_1 Hospital_name State Staffed_beds ## Min. : 10001 Length:712 Length:712 Min. : 7.0 ## 1st Qu.:100311 Class :character Class :character 1st Qu.: 141.5 ## Median :230273 Mode :character Mode :character Median : 242.5 ## Mean :248324 Mean : 295.2 ## 3rd Qu.:370018 3rd Qu.: 380.5 ## Max. :670073 Max. :1750.0 ## ## Total_discharges Patient_days Gross_patient_revenue num_phys ## Min. : 12 Min. : 37 Min. : 3736 Min. : 1.000 ## 1st Qu.: 5101 1st Qu.: 20188 1st Qu.: 456340 1st Qu.: 1.000 ## Median :10860 Median : 46707 Median : 923908 Median : 1.000 ## Mean :13194 Mean : 63369 Mean : 1347802 Mean : 1.784 ## 3rd Qu.:17680 3rd Qu.: 85566 3rd Qu.: 1718996 3rd Qu.: 2.000 ## Max. :77757 Max. :425114 Max. :14140692 Max. :12.000 ## NA&#39;s :5 ## female_prop avg_grad_year n_specialty EHR_use ## Min. :0.000 Min. :1965 Min. :1.000 1:199 ## 1st Qu.:0.000 1st Qu.:2004 1st Qu.:1.000 0:513 ## Median :0.500 Median :2008 Median :1.000 ## Mean :0.512 Mean :2007 Mean :1.662 ## 3rd Qu.:1.000 3rd Qu.:2011 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :1.000 Max. :2016 Max. :8.000 ## table(hosps[which(hosps$num_phys &lt;= 10),]$EHR_use) ## ## 1 0 ## 198 513 Well, we managed to get about {r} (nrow(hosps)/nrow(hosp_clean))*100% match on the hospitals between the two data sets and the summary statistics on those hospital demographics look a lot nicer and less skewed! &lt;——actually check this again on final run!!!! Even though we aggregated the physicial-level demographics because we didn’t want to just throw away data, we do acknowledge that these physician-level demographics are not really meaningful because they are not representative of the demographics of the hospital. It is unlikely that we had all the physicians information from our hosp_afl for each hospital that matched. (i.e. the 10 physicians we have data on for a hospital may not accurately represent the all practitioners in that hospital) We thought of excluding hospitals with less than 10 practitioners in the data to obtain accurate physician demographics for the hospital, but it would mean cutting down way to much of our limite data. We decided to just focus on the main hospital demographics scraped from the website, and keep the aggregated physician demographics at the exploratory level. Merging with hosp_afl still provided us the main outcome of interest, “EHR_use (the hospital uses the electronic health system)”, calculated as 1 if at least one practitioner in the hopstial uses EHR and 0 if none of the practitioners in the hospital uses EHR - that’s why we took the maximum in our code above. Reminder that for practitioners affiliated with hospitals, we assumed that EHR use is the hospital-level adoption and not individual’s. Thus it makes sense that if at least one of the practitioners is recorded in the data as using EHR, we will assume the hospital uses EHR. 4.2.3 Output # clean up intermediate data sets rm(hosp_web, hosp_afl) # hosp_clean will be used later in secondary regional analysis # permanently save hospital-level analysis dataset to repo saveRDS(hosps, file = &quot;./data/hosps.rds&quot;) Again, we are storing the hosps data set as a .rds file in our repo under the /data directory for reproducibility of our analysis since it will be used to analyze the potential effects of hospital demographics on the use of EHR, which is another aspect of our Primary Analysis. This data set will also be subsequently merge with the EHR vendor and product information discussed in the next section to explore hospital demographics by specific types of EHR used. 4.3 Vendors &amp; Products (EHR) Since so many professionals and hospitals across the U.S. have already adopted EHR, we realized that simplying looking at the binary outcome of EHR use would be too boring of a project. Thus, we were curious to further explore the demographics of those who do use EHR by the specific types of EHR vendor or product. Fortunately, we were able to find data to support this additional secondary/exploratory analysis. 4.3.1 Source/Metadata The Health IT Dashboard provides certified health IT product data from the ONC Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) such as the unique vendors, products, and product types of each certified health IT product used as part of the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. We downloaded only the 2016 dataset, which also includes unique provider identifiers (NPI), in order to match the EPs dataset discussed in the first section of this chapter. As the metadata explains, a provider in this dataset can be either an eligible professional (EP) and eligible hospital (Hospital), as distinguished by the Provider_Type column. Thus, only the Provider_Type == 'EP' records is merged with the subset of EPs who are not affiliated with any hospital, and the Provider_Type == 'Hospital' records is merged with the subset of EPs who are affiliated with a hospital, and therefore directly merged with the combined and cleaned version of the hosp dataset discussed in the previous section of this chapter.

It makes sense since these variables would not be relevant to an eligible professional (EP), who is not affiliated with any hospital. There are exactly 20073 records of missing zip codes and blank specialty (specifically not NA’s), and this number matches up with the number of Provider_Type == 'Hospital'. It sounds like the first step we may need to do is to split the data into EPs and hospitals since there are enough distinct variables relevant for each type. Then we can merge each split with their corresponding demographic data from the previous sections. We want to inner join with the EPs data set on NPI, which has one row per physician by their unique NPI (one-to-many merge) We want to inner join with the hosps data set on CCN, which has one row per hospital by their unique CCN (one-to-many merge) # split for EPs EHR_EPs &lt;- EHR_clean %&gt;% filter(Provider_Type == &#39;EP&#39;) %&gt;% select(-CCN, -Hospital_Type, -Provider_Type) # merge with EPs data EHR_EPs &lt;- inner_join(EHR_EPs, EPs, by=c(&#39;NPI&#39;=&#39;npi&#39;)) # split for hospitals EHR_hosps &lt;- EHR_clean %&gt;% filter(Provider_Type == &#39;Hospital&#39;) %&gt;% select(-ZIP, -Specialty, -Provider_Type) # merge with hosps data EHR_hosps &lt;- inner_join(EHR_hosps, hosps, by=c(&#39;CCN&#39;=&#39;hosp_afl_1&#39;)) specific product types are too dirty and not meaningful, will focus on vendor types. notice that the ehr column is not all y when we expect them to be. this explains why we had so many physicians who fell in the ehr='' category. the physicians whom we have EHR product usage information on did not answer “yes” to EHR use in the original EPs data. again the top primary specialties overall are 306, 247, 201, 128, 108, compare that to the top specialities among physicians whom we have vendor information: 30, 25, 15, 13, 12. merge with the cleaned hosp data 4.3.3 Output Although the specific product types are too granular and not meaningful enough to clean, we believe that exploring the professional and hospital demographics across vendor types may still be interesting, especially if we focus on the top 10 most popular vendors or classify the smaller local vendors as one group.

EPs &lt;- readRDS(&quot;./data/EPs.rds&quot;) [explain that we are doing logistic regression model because of our binary outcome EHR use, and write out the mathematical theory and methods here.] 5.1.1 Exploratory Before fitting our model, we explored the relationships between our variables of interest using Association Rule Learning. We will use the R package called arulesViz to help us visualize this because we have mostly categorical variables with too many levels for simple correlation matrices to handle.

Let’s first trim this down a bit to show only important rules (confidence &gt; 0.85). We’ll pick the top 30 rules so we have a smaller subset to find meaningful relationships. The top 30 rules are chosen with respect to the lift measure (a measure of rule strength) - the deviation of the support of the whole rule from the support expected under independence given the supports of both sides of the rule. subrules &lt;- rules[quality(rules)$confidence &gt; 0.85] inspect(head(sort(subrules, by =&quot;lift&quot;),30)) ## lhs rhs support confidence lift count ## [1] {st=OK} =&gt; {gndr=M} 0.01068376 1.0000000 2.197183 5 ## [2] {grd_yr=2012, ## pri_spec=CHIROPRACTIC} =&gt; {gndr=M} 0.01282051 1.0000000 2.197183 6 ## [3] {pri_spec=DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY} =&gt; {gndr=M} 0.01282051 0.8571429 1.883300 6 ## [4] {grd_yr=2007, ## pri_spec=OPTOMETRY} =&gt; {gndr=M} 0.01282051 0.8571429 1.883300 6 ## [5] {grd_yr=2007, ## pri_spec=NURSE PRACTITIONER} =&gt; {gndr=F} 0.01068376 1.0000000 1.835294 5 ## [6] {pri_spec=NURSE PRACTITIONER} =&gt; {gndr=F} 0.05555556 0.9629630 1.767320 26 ## [7] {pri_spec=PEDIATRIC MEDICINE} =&gt; {gndr=F} 0.01709402 0.8888889 1.631373 8 plot(subrules, method=&quot;grouped&quot;, control=list(k=50)) We concluded the following: Practitioner graduation year is not very interesting Medical School, Primary Specialty, and Gender had the most meaningful associations However, we would choose only one of medical school or primary specialty. They are likely highly correlated because there are specialty-specific schools such as chiropractic schools. Now we need to explore the relationships of our continuous independent variables Years since graduation by gender using jittered violin plots EPs %&gt;% melt(id.vars=&quot;gndr&quot;, measure.vars=&quot;yrs_grd&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(gndr, value)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.75) + facet_grid(variable ~ .) + scale_y_sqrt() Gender seems to be pretty independent of the number of years since graduation so we should be able to add both to the model without influencing each other’s effects. The distribution of years since graduation is skewed, so we used a square root scale to make the kernel density curves look more symmetric in the plots than it otherwise would have been. The actual values of the years since graduation were left alone so we could intuitively interpret the results from our model. Number of locations by gender using jittered violin plots EPs %&gt;% melt(id.vars=&quot;gndr&quot;, measure.vars=&quot;locations&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(gndr, value)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.75) + facet_grid(variable ~ .) + scale_y_log10() While practice locations seem to be distributed evenly between males and females, note that the large majority of physicians in our data set have only one location. There are a few outliers who have over 300 unique zip codes associated with their practices. Years since graduation by credentials using bubble plots EPs %&gt;% mutate(cred = reorder(cred, yrs_grd)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(cred, yrs_grd)) + stat_sum(aes(size = ..n.., group = 1)) + scale_size_area(max_size = 10) Credentials (physician degrees) had one of the fewest number of levels, so we wanted to see if it was a good candidate for our model. The distribution of years since graduation looked pretty consistent across different credentials. Unfortunately, there were disproportionally high numbers of physicians with credentials listed as N/A (~75%), meaning their credential was unknown, so we could not use this variable in our model. Gender, years since graduation, and number of locations by EHR use # scatter plot matrix of all three effects by EHR use my_colors &lt;- brewer.pal(nlevels(as.factor(EPs$ehr)), &quot;Set1&quot;) ## Warning in brewer.pal(nlevels(as.factor(EPs$ehr)), &quot;Set1&quot;): minimal value for n is 3, returning requested palette with 3 different levels EPs %&gt;% mutate(gender = as.factor(as.integer(gndr))) %&gt;% scatterplotMatrix(~gender+yrs_grd+locations|ehr, data=., col=my_colors, smoother.args=list(col=&quot;grey&quot;), cex=1.5 , pch=c(15,16), legend.pos=&quot;center&quot;) # bubble plot of years since graduation by EHR use EPs %&gt;% ggplot(aes(ehr, yrs_grd)) + stat_sum(aes(size = ..n.., group = 1)) + scale_size_area(max_size = 10) # jittered violin plot of years since graduation by EHR use EPs %&gt;% melt(id.vars=&quot;ehr&quot;, measure.vars=&quot;yrs_grd&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(ehr, value)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) + geom_violin(alpha = 0.75) + facet_grid(variable ~ .) + scale_y_sqrt() Note that we forced gender, which is binary, into the scatter plot matrix so just ignore any noise between the values 1 and 2 on the scale for gender. Again, we can confirm that all three variables of interest (gender, years since graduation, and number of locations) are not strongly correlated with each other at all. We can safely add them into the final model without interaction terms. From the this scatter plot matrix, it is apparent that the distribution of gender and years since graduation differ by EHR use (as indicated by the red and blue colors, blinded here because we want to give you some suspense dun dun dun - but actually, we just couldn’t get the legend to not completely cover the density curves). A general observation from the bubble and violin plots is that there are proportionally more physicians in our data who have not used EHR. so we already have an imbalance in sample size between the two groups. But overall, our sample size is still large enough. 5.1.2 Final Analysis 5.1.2.1 Fit the Logistic Model [write out our final model] # fit the model model &lt;- glm(ehr ~ gndr + yrs_grd + locations, data = EPs, family = binomial) summary(model) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = ehr ~ gndr + yrs_grd + locations, family = binomial, ## data = EPs) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.5328 -0.3522 -0.2465 -0.2338 2.7075 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Holding gender (male) and locations at a fixed value, the odds of adopting EHR has a 1.8% increase for each additional year since graduation. We did not find a statistically significant effect in the number of practice locations on the use of EHR, so this makes me feel better about collapsing the records by unique physicians and losing the specific location information like city, state, and zip code. If owning practices in various different locations had an effect on EHR use, then we would have needed to consider fitting a mixed effects model that takes into account the random effects of the different locations these physicians practice in, or consider a repeated measures analysis on the non-collapsed data where a physician can have repeated records for each unique location of their practice, etc. But since we lack statistical evidence for the number of practice locations to show an effect on EHR use, we have no reason to seek a better model to fit. 5.1.2.2 Predicted Probabilities We can look at the effects of varying years since graduation by gender while holding the number of practice locations constant at its sample mean on the outcome of EHR use with a ribbon plot of the predicted probabilities. # create a table of predicted probabilities varying the value of years since graduation and gender varyvals &lt;- with(EPs, data.frame(yrs_grd = rep(seq(from = min(yrs_grd), to = max(yrs_grd), length.out = 100), 2), locations = mean(locations), gndr = factor(rep(c(&#39;M&#39;,&#39;F&#39;), each = 100)))) pred &lt;- cbind(varyvals, predict(model, newdata = varyvals, type = &quot;link&quot;, se = TRUE)) pred &lt;- within(pred, { PredictedProb &lt;- plogis(fit) LL &lt;- plogis(fit - (1.96 * se.fit)) UL &lt;- plogis(fit + (1.96 * se.fit)) }) # ribbon plot ggplot(pred, aes(x = yrs_grd, y = PredictedProb)) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = LL, ymax = UL, fill = gndr), alpha = 0.2) + geom_line(aes(colour = gndr), size = 1) Well, how well does the model with these predictors fit compared to a null model? Let’s perform the likelihood ratio test using a chi-square test of {r} with(model, null.deviance - deviance) (the difference in deviance for the two models) with {r} with(model, df.null - df.residual) degrees of freedom on our observed data, which gives us the following p-value: with(model, pchisq(null.deviance - deviance, df.null - df.residual, lower.tail = FALSE)) ## [1] 0.0009280001 Looks like our model did pretty well! 5.2 Hospital Demographics Now let’s focus on the other type of providers eligible for the Medicaid &amp; Medicare EHR Incentive Program: the hospitals. Recall that in this analysis population, we included only the physicians who are affiliated with any hospital and aggregated their demographics and EHR use at the hospital level. This is beacuse the use of EHR would no longer depend on the physicians themselves, but rather the hospitals who decide to participate in the program. Since the aggregated physician demographics are not reliable demographic representations of the hospitals, as discussed in the Data chapter, we will only perform exploratory analysis on them and focus on the scraped hospital demographics (staffed beds, total discharges, patient days, gross patient revenue) for the final analysis. 5.2.1 Exploratory ggplot(hosps, aes(num_phys, colour = EHR_use)) + geom_density() + xlim(0, 500) Again, we wanted to show that our data on the physicians for each hospital are limited, and could affect our final analysis if we only subset to hospitals with sufficient physicians data in order to accurately include the aggregated physician demographics of the hospitals. my_colors &lt;- brewer.pal(nlevels(as.factor(hosps$EHR_use)), &quot;Set1&quot;) ## Warning in brewer.pal(nlevels(as.factor(hosps$EHR_use)), &quot;Set1&quot;): minimal value for n is 3, returning requested palette with 3 different levels # explore aggregated physician demographics scatterplotMatrix(~num_phys+female_prop+avg_grad_year+n_specialty|EHR_use, data=hosps, col=my_colors , smoother.args=list(col=&quot;grey&quot;) , cex=1.5 , pch=c(15,16), legend.plot=FALSE) # explore scraped hospital demographics scatterplotMatrix(~Staffed_beds+Total_discharges+Patient_days+Gross_patient_revenue|EHR_use, data=hosps, col=my_colors , smoother.args=list(col=&quot;grey&quot;) , cex=1.5 , pch=c(15,16)) The first correlation matrix of all the aggregated physician demographics at the hospital level is basically garbage. The second correlation matrix shows us that all four hospital demographics are strongly correlated with each other, which does make sense, and follow the same distributions by EHR use. We will also log-transform these demographics to help normalize their seemingly skewed distributions. hosps &lt;- hosps %&gt;% mutate(staffed_beds_log = round(log(Staffed_beds),2), total_discharges_log = round(log(Total_discharges),2), patient_days_log = round(log(Patient_days),2), gross_patient_rev_log = round(log(Gross_patient_revenue),2) ) # check for normality for one of them qqnorm(hosps$gross_patient_rev_log) qqline(hosps$gross_patient_rev_log) Let’s look at the correlation plots again with the log-transformed values. scatterplotMatrix(~staffed_beds_log+total_discharges_log+patient_days_log+gross_patient_rev_log|EHR_use, data=hosps, col=my_colors , smoother.args=list(col=&quot;grey&quot;) , cex=1.5 , pch=c(15,16), legend.pos=&quot;bottomleft&quot;) hosps %&gt;% ggplot(aes(EHR_use, gross_patient_rev_log)) + stat_sum(aes(size = ..n.., group = 1)) + scale_size_area(max_size = 10) ## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite values (stat_sum). The difference in distributions is not as apparent by the use of EHR. We believed that the gross patient revenue, which may be implying overall hospital size, is a confounding factor that affects other predictor variables. We can also observe this in the strong correlation (above 0.8) between GPR and staffed beds, GPR and total discharge, and GPR and patient days. Thus, we will stratify on gross patient revenue. Let’s see if other predictor variables still have effect on EHR use proportion after stratifying on GPR. hosps$gpr_grp = cut(hosps$gross_patient_rev_log, quantile(hosps$gross_patient_rev_log, prob = seq(0, 1, .2), na.rm = TRUE), include.lowest = TRUE) filter_var = &quot;total_discharges_log&quot; #&quot;staffed_beds_log&quot; #&quot;patient_days_log&quot; hosps %&gt;% filter(!is.na(gpr_grp)) %&gt;% group_by(gpr_grp) %&gt;% do(tidy(glm(EHR_use ~ staffed_beds_log + total_discharges_log + patient_days_log, data = ., family=&quot;binomial&quot;), conf.int = TRUE)) %&gt;% filter(term==filter_var) ## # A tibble: 5 x 8 ## # Groups: gpr_grp [5] ## gpr_grp term estimate std.error statistic ## &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 [8.23,12.9] total_discharges_log 0.4995140 1.481251 0.3372244 ## 2 (12.9,13.5] total_discharges_log 1.1669966 1.405116 0.8305341 ## 3 (13.5,14] total_discharges_log 0.3595741 1.254598 0.2866050 ## 4 (14,14.5] total_discharges_log -0.7145513 1.587193 -0.4501983 ## 5 (14.5,16.5] total_discharges_log -4.2080280 1.622126 -2.5941441 ## # ... with 3 more variables: p.value &lt;dbl&gt;, conf.low &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # conf.high &lt;dbl&gt; We are only showing the statistical results on total discharge because it is the only demographic that has a different signficance in effect on EHR use across the stratification of gross patient revenue, as evident by the p-values.

Perhaps Alaksa and Vermont have more rural environments, while many of the EHR vendors are based in the Midwest. #find what types of product settings exist levels(EHR_EPs$Product_Setting) ## [1] &quot;&quot; &quot;Ambulatory&quot; &quot;Inpatient&quot; #ambulatory vs inpatient numbers EHR_EPs %&gt;% filter(Product_Setting != &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% summarize(amb = sum(Product_Setting == &quot;Ambulatory&quot;), inp = sum(Product_Setting == &quot;Inpatient&quot;)) ## amb inp ## 1 130 9 prod_setting &lt;- EHR_EPs %&gt;% filter(Product_Setting != &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(Business_State_Territory) %&gt;% summarize(num = n(), amb = sum(Product_Setting == &quot;Ambulatory&quot;), inpat = sum(Product_Setting == &quot;Inpatient&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(p_amb = amb/num, p_inpp = inpat/num) # table for overall percentages in merge dataset prod_setting_overall &lt;- EHR_EPs %&gt;% summarize(total = n(), amb = sum(Product_Setting == &quot;Ambulatory&quot;), inpat = sum(Product_Setting == &quot;Inpatient&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(&quot;Ambulatory (Outpatient)&quot; = amb/total, Inpatient= inpat/total) %&gt;% mutate(st = &quot;Overall&quot;) %&gt;% select(st, &quot;Ambulatory (Outpatient)&quot;, Inpatient) prod_setting_overall %&gt;% kable st Ambulatory (Outpatient) Inpatient Overall 0.9285714 0.0642857 ambulatory &lt;- prod_setting %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_map(aes(map_id = id), data = fifty_states, map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;, fill=&quot;grey90&quot;) + geom_map(aes(map_id = tolower(Business_State_Territory), fill = p_amb), map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;) + coord_map() + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(6, &quot;RdYlBu&quot;)) + expand_limits(x=states_map$long, y=states_map$lat) + theme_gray() + theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.line = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Product Setting = Ambulatory&quot;) inpatient &lt;- prod_setting %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_map(aes(map_id = id), data = fifty_states, map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;, fill=&quot;grey90&quot;) + geom_map(aes(map_id = tolower(Business_State_Territory), fill = p_inpp), map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;) + coord_map() + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(6, &quot;RdYlBu&quot;)) + expand_limits(x=states_map$long, y=states_map$lat) + theme_gray() + theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.line = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Product Setting = Inpatient&quot;) grid.arrange(ambulatory, inpatient, nrow = 1) # california = outlier cali &lt;- EHR_EPs %&gt;% filter(Business_State_Territory == &quot;California&quot;) %&gt;% summarize(total = n(), amb = sum(Product_Setting == &quot;Ambulatory&quot;), inpat = sum(Product_Setting == &quot;Inpatient&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(&quot;Ambulatory (Outpatient)&quot; = amb/total, Inpatient = inpat/total) %&gt;% select(&quot;Ambulatory (Outpatient)&quot;, Inpatient) prod_setting_overall &lt;- bind_rows(prod_setting_overall, data_frame(State = &quot;California&quot;, &quot;Ambulatory (Outpatient)&quot; = cali$`Ambulatory (Outpatient)`, Inpatient = cali$Inpatient )) prod_setting_overall %&gt;% kable st Ambulatory (Outpatient) Inpatient State Overall 0.9285714 0.0642857 NA NA 0.6428571 0.3571429 California Product Setting refers to the type of practice setting that the EHR product is certified for. The possible settings are: Ambulatory: doctor’s offices, clinics, and other outpatient facilities Inpatient: hospitals and other long-term care facilities We found that most EHR products were certified for ambulatory settings, by far. This extreme preference in ambulatory EHR products is consistent across the country, except in California where there is still a slight preference for ambulatory EHR products (among those adopting EHR’s in the incentive program), but it is less than the rest of the country. # how many unique vendors length(unique(factor(EHR_EPs$Vendor_Name))) ## [1] 43 # find top 10 vendors top10 &lt;- EHR_EPs %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Vendor_Name)) %&gt;% group_by(Vendor_Name) %&gt;% summarize(num = n()) %&gt;% arrange(desc(num)) %&gt;% top_n(10) ## Selecting by num #unique vendors vendors &lt;- as.vector(top10$Vendor_Name) # distribution of top 10 vendors EHR_EPs %&gt;% filter(Vendor_Name %in% vendors) %&gt;% group_by(Vendor_Name) %&gt;% summarise(num = n()) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Vendor_Name, num), y = num)) + geom_bar(stat=&#39;identity&#39;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) # percent usage of top 10 sum(top10$num)/nrow(EHR_EPs) ## [1] 0.7142857 pct_popvendors &lt;- EHR_EPs %&gt;% group_by(Business_State_Territory) %&gt;% summarize(num = n(), total_v = sum(Vendor_Name %in% vendors), opp = num - total_v) %&gt;% mutate(p_vend = total_v/num, u_vend = opp/num) pct_popvendors %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_map(aes(map_id = id), data = fifty_states, map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;, fill=&quot;grey90&quot;) + geom_map(aes(map_id = tolower(Business_State_Territory), fill = p_vend), map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;) + coord_map() + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(6, &quot;RdYlBu&quot;)) + expand_limits(x=states_map$long, y=states_map$lat) + theme_gray() + theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.line = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Usage of Top 10 Vendors&quot;) We found that the majority of EHR products used were from the top 10 vendors. Interestingly, though, Minnesota had almost 100% usage of the top 10 vendors. This could potentially be because many of the big vendors are based in the Midwest (ie Epic, Mayo Clinic, Cerner, etc). #most common specialties in general EHR_EPs %&gt;% group_by(pri_spec) %&gt;% summarize(num = n()) %&gt;% arrange(desc(num)) ## # A tibble: 20 x 2 ## pri_spec num ## &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 OPTOMETRY 30 ## 2 DERMATOLOGY 25 ## 3 FAMILY PRACTICE 15 ## 4 CHIROPRACTIC 13 ## 5 OPHTHALMOLOGY 12 ## 6 ENDOCRINOLOGY 6 ## 7 NEUROLOGY 6 ## 8 PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION 6 ## 9 ANESTHESIOLOGY 5 ## 10 ORAL SURGERY 5 ## 11 OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY 3 ## 12 PSYCHIATRY 3 ## 13 INTERNAL MEDICINE 2 ## 14 OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATIVE MEDICINE 2 ## 15 PODIATRY 2 ## 16 DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY 1 ## 17 PAIN MANAGEMENT 1 ## 18 PEDIATRIC MEDICINE 1 ## 19 PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT 1 ## 20 PULMONARY DISEASE 1 # most common state -&gt; specialty specialty &lt;- EHR_EPs %&gt;% group_by(Business_State_Territory, pri_spec) %&gt;% summarize(num = n()) %&gt;% arrange(Business_State_Territory, desc(num)) #check similar specialties #EHR_EPs %&gt;% filter(grepl(&quot;PSYCH&quot;, pri_spec)) %&gt;% distinct(pri_spec) specialty %&gt;% ggplot(aes(Business_State_Territory, pri_spec)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = num)) When it came to looking at patterns between primary specialty and states, it was nearly impossible to find useful information.

Additionally, we tried to find group similar specialties but it did not make the results much more interpretable. 6.1.2 Hospital Demographics GET RID OF THIS IF HOSP DAT ALREADY CLEAN #load hosp_all data &amp; add long state names state_name &lt;- c(state.name,&quot;District Of Columbia&quot;) states &lt;- data.frame(state_name = state_name, state_abb = c(state.abb, &quot;DC&quot;)) hosp_all &lt;- hosp_clean %&gt;% left_join(states, by = c(&quot;State&quot; = &quot;state_abb&quot;)) ## Warning: Column `State`/`state_abb` joining character vector and factor, ## coercing into character vector beds &lt;- hosp_all %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Staffed_beds)) %&gt;% group_by(state_name) %&gt;% summarize(avgbed = mean(Staffed_beds)) beds %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_map(aes(map_id = id), data = fifty_states, map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;, fill=&quot;grey90&quot;) + geom_map(aes(map_id = tolower(state_name), fill = avgbed), map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;) + coord_map() + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(6, &quot;RdYlBu&quot;)) + expand_limits(x=states_map$long, y=states_map$lat) + theme_gray() + theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.line = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Average hospital Beds per hospital&quot;) Vermont and Rhode Island had the lowest number of average hospital beds per hospital, which makes sense since they are small states.

The differences were: Florida had one of the highest averages for hospital beds (biggest hospitals) but did not have one of the highest average patient days (yay!) Massachusetts, which was slightly above average in the number of hospital beds, ended up being one of the states with the longest patient days on average. #total discharges hosp_all %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Total_discharges)) %&gt;% group_by(state_name) %&gt;% summarize(discharges = mean(Total_discharges)) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_map(aes(map_id = id), data = fifty_states, map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;, fill=&quot;grey90&quot;) + geom_map(aes(map_id = tolower(state_name), fill = discharges), map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;) + coord_map() + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(6, &quot;RdYlBu&quot;)) + expand_limits(x=states_map$long, y=states_map$lat) + theme_gray() + theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.line = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Across states, mean discharges days per hospital on average&quot;) The distribution of average discharges was not very interesting - it was similar to the previous maps. #avg revenue per discharge revenue &lt;- hosp_all %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Gross_patient_revenue) &amp; !is.na(Total_discharges)) %&gt;% mutate(per = Gross_patient_revenue/Total_discharges) %&gt;% group_by(State) %&gt;% summarize(rev = mean(per)) revenue %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_map(aes(map_id = id), data = fifty_states, map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;, fill=&quot;grey90&quot;) + geom_map(aes(map_id = tolower(state_name), fill = rev), map = fifty_states, color=&quot;grey50&quot;) + coord_map() + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(6, &quot;RdYlBu&quot;)) + expand_limits(x=states_map$long, y=states_map$lat) + theme_gray() + theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.line = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Across states, average revenue per discharge&quot;) Looks like Montana has the highest average gross patient revenue per discharge. 6.1.3 Regional Conclusions The regional analyses served mostly exploratory/informational purposes. While we noticed many patterns regarding the Midwest, it is not clear if the patterns are due to association or causation. For example, we saw that the Midwestern states tended to have higher rates of EHR usage compared to the rest of the country. However, we also saw that many of the “Top 10” vendors in our dataset were also based in the Midwest. There could have been confounding effects - our data set may not have been representative of the entire country - Healthit.gov cited over 75% of Physician EHR adoption by 2015, while our data set could only match about 20% EHR usage in 2016. We could have had a skewed sample of Physicians that happened to have more EHR adoptees living in the Midwest. Also, the first plot showed that we did have strong representation in Physician counts in Minnesota and California, but not as much in the rest of the country. 6.2 By EHR Vendors 6.2.1 Physician Demographics Check the distributions of number of practice locations, states, products, and vendors among practitioners whom we have EHR usage information on.

Interesting conclusions from the jitter plot: Integrated Practice Solutions, Inc, the second most popular vendor in our data set, is exclusively used by chiropractors. They also dominate the other vendors among the chiropractors. Eyefinity, Inc also has a specific audience, with only opthalmologists and optometrists (eye doctors) using their products. Compulink Business Systems, Inc, is also very popular among the two eye specialties and their products seem to be targeted for a specific audience. While NextGen Healthcare is used by all the top 10 specialties, they are most popular among the opthalmologists and optometrists. Modernizing Medicine Inc is very popular among dermatologists. Epic Systems, Cerner Corporation, athenahealth, and GE Healthcare are pretty consistently used across all the top 10 disciplines. Epic is the most consistently popular, however. Explore practitioner demographics: gender, graduation year, medical school attended, primary specialty. The following demographic relationships are among physicians not affiliated with any hospitals whom we have EHR vendor and product information on.

Let’s first trim this down a bit to show only important rules (confidence &gt; 0.85). We’ll pick the top 30 rules so we have a smaller subset to find meaningful relationships. The top 30 rules are chosen with respect to the lift measure (a measure of rule strength) - the deviation of the support of the whole rule from the support expected under independence given the supports of both sides of the rule. subrules &lt;- rules[quality(rules)$confidence &gt; 0.85] inspect(head(sort(subrules, by =&quot;lift&quot;),30)) plot(subrules, method=&quot;grouped&quot;, control=list(k=50)) The top 18 rules show that the strongest associations are among practitioners who use 5 EHR products across 2 different vendors in the state of Minnesota within a single practice. The second highest set of rules shows a strong association among practitioners who use 7 EHR products across 2 different vendors in the state of California within a single practice. To explore the top rules, we created a couple visualizations. We can visualize these top 18 rules using a directed network graph where the items are vertices and the directed edges are the rules in the direction of the antecedent (IF) to the consequent (THEN). (check this?) top18 &lt;- head(sort(subrules, by =&quot;lift&quot;),18) plot(top18, method=&quot;graph&quot;) # uses items and rules as vertices connecting them with directed edges plot(top18, method=&quot;graph&quot;, control=list(type=&quot;itemsets&quot;)) # uses itemsets as vertices and rules are represented by directed edges In a parallel coordinates plot, the width of the arrows represents support and the intensity of the color represent confidence. We plotted the top 18 rules. plot(top18, method=&quot;paracoord&quot;, control=list(reorder=TRUE)) Using Associative Rule Learning, we found the following factors were important: number of EHR products used number of vendors used region (states) "]
